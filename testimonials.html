<h1>Testimonials</h1>
<p>First class  operation!!! from the website to the shipping-- 48 hrs after arrival all fish  are doing swimmingly</p>
<p>-Thanks <br>
  John</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you for calling me back right away, for taking your  time in explaining and answering all my questions and concerns, for being very  nice with you responses and for being sincerely honest.&nbsp; You even told me to buy a Blue German Ram  from a local pet store and try it in my tank with the discus.</p>
<p>  Then if I ever decide to add more to call you back at a  later time.&nbsp; Wow, that is rarely heard of  in today's world.&nbsp; It proves that there  are still caring, kind and absolute awesome individuals like you and your company  still in existence today!!</p>
<p>Thanks again for everything and I look forward to getting  these new fish from such a great company.</p>
<p>Respectfully,<br>
  Jim</p>
<hr>
<p>Hey Tom,</p>
<p>  Just wanted to say thanks for the quality, healthy blue rams you sent to  me.<br>
  I set up the aquarium as you suggested and used a drip acclimatization.  Within a few hours the rams were up and running, and, they ate well the next  morning.</p>
<p>  Thanks again Man!<br>
  <br>
  Debu.</p>
<hr>
<p>I got all the fish today. All survived and all  are absolutely 
  beautiful.Honestly, the most beautiful I have ever received and I  have been keeping rainbows  for 10+ years. <br>
  <br>
  I am likely going to place another order as soon as next week. <br>
  <br>
  Thanks so much. <br>
  <br>
  Bill</p>
<hr>
<p>I am very pleased with your service and your fish. I will  recommend you to everyone. <br>
  <br>
  Thanks a bunch, on behalf of my brother, James who is disabled. I  would like to say that ODDBALLFISH came through with the order and shipping  with wonderful flying colors as is their fish.We purchased a combo  package for a 40gal tower. The fish were delivered exactly when they  said they would be. The packaging was of excellent quality and the  fish arrived after approx 1,300 mi. undamaged and very, very  healthy. Can't wait to get a tank started for myself. <br>
  THANKS, ODDBALLFISH </p>
<p>  Suzann, Jimmy’s sister, you brought a lot of joy into a mans heart, where also  the fish reside!!! </p>
<hr>
<p>Tom,<br>
  <br>
  Fish have arrived and are in beautiful condition!<br>
  <br>
  Note: BRAVO! The Blue Rams are amazing!! The most beautiful Blue Rams I have  ever seen!!<br>
  <br>
  Thank you! </p>
<hr>
<p>Wow! Purchasing fish from you was an absolute treat and my only  regret is that you don't carry more of my personal favorites! <br>
  <br>
  I shared an order with a friend who purchased four dwarf neon rainbows and I  ordered five longfin white clouds. They arrived in excellent condition and we  couldn't be more happy! <br>
  <br>
  The dwarf rainbows are all stunning fish that shine even from a distance and I  am having great fun watching my new white clouds displaying for each other. <br>
  <br>
  As a small business owner myself (I design original, handmade jewelry), I am  very happy to support another home business owner whose love shows in what they  produce. </p>
<hr>
<p>  The fish arrived in great condition.They are beautiful and I love  the threadfins.Thanks so much.</p>
<p>I just received my order from you Friday afternoon. I purchased 4  blue rams and 2 gold. I have to say they are the most beautiful fish I have  seen yet. Thank you for your dedication to raising quality fish for us, the  hobbyist.</p>
<p>I ordered some long fin white clouds and they arrived yesterday. I  just wanted to comment on the excellent customer service, and also the  extremely beautiful and high quality fish.</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response. I have heard really good things  about your fish on plantedtank.net where I hang out. Looking forward to the new  additions.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hello Tom!!! </p>
<p>  Just wanted to let you know all my new babies arrived in  excellent shape...They adjusted really well to my tanks and was glad  to see the afternoon snack.All were really to eat, the red rainbows  were a bit more reserved than the rest but are doing fine now... They enjoyed  the bloodworms at the night time snack... </p>
<p>  I was wondering if you could send me an email when you have  some yellow rainbows ready to ship...Really missed not getting any  of them this time around.. As you could tell, they are one of my favorites and  so beautiful in the tanks... </p>
<p>  Thanks again for the beautiful fish and all your dedication  for people like me to be able to own good, healthy fish.... <br>
  <br>
  PAT HARRIS</p>

<p>Thanks.I will be back to purchase from you in the future in  light of the good service.<br>

<hr>
<p>I recently placed an order through you and the fish have been here  for only a few days but I must say that these are excellent quality  fish. It has been a while since I kept Rainbows but the ones I have  received from you are by far the most stunning I have ever  seen. Also, some of the Peacock Gudgeons I have received from you  have already started breeding. I am thoroughly impressed and I want  to thank you for everything.You really got something good going on  over there. <br>
  <br>
  Sincerely, <br>
  <br>

<p>Wherever you picked up these Blue Rams, don't switch  providers. [Oddballfish.com is the hatchery] These are incredibly gorgeous in color, and extremely  lively--they were eating food on the first day!I was nervous about the 2  day ship, but the fact that you watch the weather convinced me that the safety  of the fish was your first concern, unlike any other internet fish store I know  of. I love this specific species because they aren't very aggressive, (I  have a community tank with various tetras, loaches, and a pair of angelfish)  and you are the only store that had these in stock. <br>
  <br>
  Well, I don't mean to take up too much of your time, but I wanted to let you  know these are the best-looking fish I have purchased to date.I will be  back when I'm ready for more fish!<br>
  <br>
  Thanks a ton,<br>

<p> I  have been burnt several times online and when I saw my fish hadn’t shipped the  day after they were supposed to per your online site I freaked. I had looked  for these for a long time. In praise all my fish arrived in great shape,  beautiful, and perky, great packaging and already I think I have at least 2  pair mated off. I want to say this is my best online experience and was treated  with more courtesy and professionalism. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Hi Tom, the fish came in yesterday all healthy+ looked good.  They are doing great and adjusting well today. Thank you for sending the 3  extra fish!</p>
<p>  We are excited to watch them grow plus develop more color. I  didn't realize how largethe other rainbows have gotten from our first  order with you until yesterday when I added the new fish. The new fish show  nice coloration already, but the older original rainbow fish are just beautiful  now they almost sparkle with color.</p>
<p>  Thanks again, <br>
  Carol </p>
<hr>
<p>  These Rams are the friendliest that I have ever seen too. When I was  changing water they would come right up to my hand.They were not  shy at all like I have seen Rams in the past. <br>
  Thanks for some great fish! If I need any more, I know where to  come! <br>
  <br>

<p>I just received my first order of livestock from Oddballfish.com, and  I was very impressed with the beauty and health of the specimens along with  expedient service and an affordable shipping rate. I will definitely be a  repeat customer.</p>
<p>  Karen</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Tom, <br>
  The rainbows arrived in excellent condition and are  absolutely beautiful.Thank you so very much for answering emails  and the gorgeous fish....Till next order... <br>
  <br>
  Thanks, <br>
  PAT</p>
<hr>
<p>  I just wanted to say thank you for everything. I received the 5 Threadfins  today and they were all very healthy. Now my one lonely Threadfin will have 5  mates to make a little shoal. <br>
  <br>
  Cheers and all the best, <br>
  Coleman</p>
<hr>
<p>  The fish arrived in good shape yesterday. Your fish are  always more beautiful than the same kind in fish stores! The colors are  brighter, and they are more active. These rams have such big fins, with  color on them!<br>
  <br>
  It also looks like you sent me extra ones without charging for  them—thank you for that.<br>
  <br>
  Best wishes, <br>
  <br>
  John </p>
<hr>
<p>The fish appeared to be in excellent  condition, and the colors are the best I have ever seen on albino paradise  gouramis.  Later this year, if I can find room, I intend to  order some of your long fin white clouds. <br>
  <br>
  Thanks for the quality fish and for answering my emails. <br>
  <br>
  John</p>
<hr>
<p>My complements to you, again! I say "again"  as I made my second purchase from Oddball about a week ago. Once again I  received the most fantastic Blue Rams I have seen. The color and health of your  fish is beyond compare--certainly much better than I can find at any LFS. <br>
  <br>
  Although I dropped you a line after my first purchase, I wanted to drop you  another to share my 110% satisfaction.I could not believe the  condition of the Rams I received to fulfill my most recent order. The fish  arrived so healthy and in such great condition I had one of the two females  spawn for me TWO DAYS AFTER INTRODUCTION to my tank.To me this is  truly an indication of your quality product.In my experience, weeks  of conditioning would be required prior to spawning of any fish I have  purchased--not the case here. <br>
  <br>
  Thank you for maintaining the high standards that obviously show through in your  product! <br>
  <br>
  I now have a brood of about 180 fry that have been well tended by both male and  female--simply a joy to watch!<br>
  <br>
  Thank you! <br>
  <br>
  Sincerely, <br>
  <br>
  Mitch</p>

<p>About a month ago I purchased 2 extra large German Blue Rams, and  let me tell you they are beautiful--the finest specimens I have ever seen! The  size, the color, and the health are fantastic!They arrived in great  shape! Your care in packaging obviously results in arrival of healthy fish. <br>
  <br>
  While the cost of ordering only 2 fishes plus shipping was considerably more  than acquiring the same at a LFS, the quality and health of your fishes is well  worth the extra. Your Rams are far superior to any that I have seen--I am 110%  satisfied! <br>
  <br>
  Interesting behavioral phenomenon has occurred that has been a joy to watch. I  had requested a male and a female, and thought initially I had received one of  each. The pair arrived, one with the characteristic female markings (Solid blue  "dot" vs. the male's black "dot.")I noted  considerable chasing by the male of the other fish, and assumed it was  courtship; however, to my surprise, once the fish were "settled in" I  noted that the female was actually a male that was displaying female  characteristics in response to the other, dominant male. Recently, I have noted  the dominance has switched, and the fish’s coloration has reversed--the  original dominant male is now displaying "female" characteristic blue  dot, and the other is now the King of the tank.Simply fantastic,  this display of nature is! The lesser male changing its coloration to relieve  aggression from the dominant one--WOW! <br>
  <br>
  I will soon order more Rams from you guys, and I hope to get two females.  Hopefully you will be able to provide the same; I would love to see some  pairing and spawning activity of these incredible specimen’s! <br>
  <br>
  Thank you for providing aquarium a-fish-ionados such a great source of healthy,  colorful, top-notch fish.I have recommended your site to a number  of fellow hobbyists--I can't say enough how pleased I am with the fish; you have  a customer for life here! <br>
  <br>
  Kind regards, <br>

<p>I just wanted to tell you that my featherfins and peacocks came  last week.They are truly beautiful, and seem to be doing  well.Given my experience that the pictures are usually of the prize  in the bunch, and what is shipped, pales compared to it, I was happily  surprised that these were as beautiful as the picture.My only  regret is that I didn't order more featherfins (peacocks hide a lot) and  perhaps another type of rainbow.Well, maybe when things settle  in.Just wanted to assure you that I have been touting your web site to  all of my friends in the hobby. <br>
</p>
<p>Hello. Fork tail blue eyes and peacock gudgeons came in great  shape. They look beautiful in my tank. Look forward to doing more business with  you.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>  I wanted to let you know that my order of chilatherina bleheris are  flourishing.They were in beautiful shape when they arrived and  acclimated to my show tank without a problem. <br>
  Very pretty and will be recommending you to others for rainbow fish as  well.I worried about adding them directly to my tank as ick is a  terrible thing to get.The rainbows were healthy and no one has  developed any illnesses as of yet.It has been nearly two weeks with  no signs of stress or illness. </p>
<p>  Thank you and regards, <br>

<p>Great site!  I  recently purchased some Blue Crays and will soon purchase some others due to  the quality of fish and quality of feed back. But I need a place to RAVE!  Please put in a guest book or rave page. I would like to tell all of your  visitors how great the quality is here. A very rare exception to the online  experience. <br>
  <br>
  Thanks, <br>

<p>I just wanted to let you know that my 9 rainbows arrived intact.  Followed your acclimation process and they are all doing very well. Beautiful  fish. I will be ordering more from you in the near future</p>
<p>Received the fish at 11:00 am. All arrived alive and in good  shape. They went into my 20 gallon plant tank, haven't seen too much of them  since. <br>
  <br>
  These are very beautiful fish. The colors are impressive even at their young age.  They are beyond my expectations and I am very happy with them. </p>

<p>  I got my fish, T-Shirt and coffee mug today. Everything is great. If you ever  need a reference please don't hesitate to look me up. I will be sure to wear my  Tee to the next GPAS meeting. Even my wife liked it. I will probably have to  get her one on my next order. <br>
  <br>
  Thanks Again! <br>
